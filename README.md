**AutoHotkey scripts for Roblox Parkour.**

Here are some AutoHotkey scripts I made for [Roblox Parkour.](https://www.roblox.com/games/445664957/Parkour) With these you can disable different movement keys to make the game not only harder, but more refreshing and fun to play.

## Instructions
First off, you're gonna need [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for this to work (I'd suggest downloading the current version).

After you've downloaded & installed it, extract the [latest release](https://github.com/joinedspawnRoads/ParkourAHK/releases) of ParkourAHK. After doing so, you'll be greeted by those aforementioned AutoHotkey scripts! Before you run any of them, please note the following:

1. This program is for Windows only.
2. After running a script, you can press "/" to toggle it.
3. To stop running a script, you can right click on the icon in your taskbar (check hidden icons if it isn't there, and if you still can't find it, kill AutoHotkey in Task Manager).
4. The chat is not immune to the scripts, so just know that you might en up tlking like thi.

## FAQ

Q: Can this get me banned?
- A: [Kid tested, staff approved!](https://imgur.com/rKFkimo)

Q: What happens if I run them all at once?
- A: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DON'T TRY THAT.

Q: How can I change the toggle key?
- A: I suggest looking into AutoHotkey for that; it gets a little complicated.

Q: I changed the toggle key. Why won't it work?
- A: Either you didn't save it or don't realize that editing one script doesn't apply it to the rest. You must change the scripts individually.

Q: It works everywhere except for Roblox. How do I fix this?
- A: Try running it as Administrator (not Roblox).
