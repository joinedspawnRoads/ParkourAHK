**AutoHotkey scripts for Roblox Parkour.**

Here are some AutoHotkey scripts I made for [Roblox Parkour.](https://www.roblox.com/games/445664957/Parkour) With these you can disable different movement keys to make the game not only harder, but more refreshing and fun to play.

## Disclaimer
This document describes the **latest version.** Anything concerning older releases probably won't be here.

## Instructions
First off, you're gonna need [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for this to work (I'd suggest downloading the current version).

After you've downloaded & installed it, extract the [latest release](https://github.com/joinedspawnRoads/ParkourAHK/releases) of ParkourAHK (or PAHK as I've just dubbed it). After doing so, you'll be greeted by those aforementioned AutoHotkey scripts! Before you run any of them, please note the following:

1. This program is for Windows only.
2. After running a script, you can press backslash to toggle it.
3. To stop running a script, you can right click on the icon in your taskbar (check hidden icons if it isn't there, and if you still can't find it, kill AutoHotkey in Task Manager).
4. The chat is not immune to the scripts, so just know that you might en up tlking like thi.

## Keybinds
- \ = Toggle
- Alt+\ = Stop
- Alt+R = Reload
